# 🌍 FoodAidAI: Tackling Food Waste and Combating Hunger 🍽️

**FoodAidAI** is a web-based platform designed to tackle food waste and hunger by integrating cutting-edge AI technology with community-driven food donation efforts. This platform supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: **Zero Hunger** by enabling users to contribute to their community while managing their own food resources effectively.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🍎 Food Management with AI Integration

- **AI-Powered Food Recognition (via GPT-4 Vision Model & SpringAI):**  
  Users can effortlessly add food items to their inventory using the AI-powered vision model, which can recognize and categorize food products from images. This makes food management fast and accurate, even for those who may not be tech-savvy.
  
- **Manual Entry:**  
  Alternatively, users can manually input food details, including name, quantity, and expiration date, ensuring flexibility for all types of users.

### 🔔 Expiry Notifications with WhatsApp Alerts

The system sends notifications to users when food items in their inventory are nearing their expiry date (within three days). These notifications are sent via WhatsApp, providing a convenient and direct reminder. Upon receiving the alert, users can take action in one of two ways:

- **🍽️ Generate Recipes with GPT:**  
  The platform suggests recipes using the food that is about to expire, reducing food waste and promoting creativity in the kitchen.
  
- **🤝 Donate the Food:**  
  Users can choose to donate food they can’t use, ensuring it reaches those who need it the most.

### 🗺️ Geo-Location and Interactive Donation Map

When a user donates food, their location is saved using geo-location technology. This allows the platform to display donations on an interactive map that is accessible to the public. This map serves two vital purposes:

- **👥 Community Visibility:**  
  Users and community members can view donation points, making it easier for those in need or organizations helping vulnerable populations, like street children or poor people, to locate nearby food donations.
  
- **📞 Access to Donors:**  
  The map also provides contact information, so individuals or aid workers can reach out to donors, ensuring efficient distribution to those who need it most.

## 🎯 Supporting Zero Hunger (SDG 2)

By integrating food donation, intelligent food management, and AI-driven notifications, **FoodAidAI** directly supports **SDG 2: Zero Hunger**. This platform helps to:

- Reduce food waste by promoting responsible consumption.
- Increase food access for underserved communities, ensuring donated food reaches people in need.
- Foster a collaborative network where food surplus becomes a community resource.
